### A friendly bot to check in on issues and pull requests

`Check in Bot` is a simple GitHub Action to send automated messages to inactive issues and pull requests. It does not and will never do the following:

- Add labels to issues and pull requests
- Close issues and pull requests

By default this action sends the following message to issues and pull requests that are inactive for 14 or more days:

> Hello to the maintainers and watchers!
>
> There have been no updates here for the last two weeks. There might be need for a check in :)
>
> Thanks and hope all are well! ❤️

The default message is meant to remind the community around a project that there may be need to assist a new contributor, communicate that a review is taking some time and overall to facilitate communication between people who may have forgotten about something or need help.

Happy community building!
